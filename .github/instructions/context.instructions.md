# Basics

This project is an extension for the Owlbear Rodeo VTT. It uses Vite to bundle and serve assets, React and Material UI for the interface, and Zustand with the persist middleware for state management.

When writing code, prefer a functional style with readonly parameters. Use MUI components when creating UI, rather than base HTML.

# Working with the README:

Before starting on a new feature, check the README for information on how the extension works. After finishing adding a feature, if it seems like the kind of thing that should be documented in the README, update the README file.

# User interaction

Put together a step-by-step implementation plan before implementing complex features, and check your plan with the user.
