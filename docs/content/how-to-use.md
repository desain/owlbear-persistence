## How To Use

Right click a token to persist it. After that, you can manage the persisted token in the action window.

Persistence types:

-   In **unique** mode, whenever a token is updated, the persisted version of the token will be updated as well.
-   In **template** mode, you must right click a token and click 'Save to Template' to persist the current state of the selected token. After that, all new versions of the token will use the template metadata.
