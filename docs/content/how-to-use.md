Persistence types:

-   In **unique** mode, whenever a token is updated, the persisted version of the token will be updated as well.
-   In **template** mode, you must right click a token and click 'Save to Template' to persist the current state of the selected token. After that, all new versions of the token will use the template.

You can control which aspects of a token, such as its text or attachments, are persisted, by toggling the persistence properties in the action window.
